# LLM Auditor

This agent functions as an automated fact-checking layer specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the factual grounding of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It achieves this by identifying verifiable claims within the text, utilizing web search and its internal knowledge to determine their accuracy, producing a detailed report on its findings, and optionally rewriting the original response to correct any discovered inaccuracies.

## Setup and Installation
